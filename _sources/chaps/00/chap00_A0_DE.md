# Introduction to Differential Equations

This chapter lays the foundation for you to learn ordinary differential equations by touching on 
 basic concepts in differential equations particularly ordinary differential equations, and
 some analytical methods for solving ordinary differential equations.

After completing this chapter, you should be able to 

- Identify the type, order, degree, linearity and homogeneity of differential equations;

- Understand the definition of initial value problems;

- Find analytical solutions to separable first-order ordinary differential equations;

- Find analytical solutions to linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients.

<!-- gives an introduction to differential equations (DEs), touching on:

- **[Basic concepts in differential equations](chap:pre:1)**
- **[Basic concepts in ordinary differential equations](chap:pre:2)**
- **[Analytical methods for solving ordinary differential equations](chap:pre:3)**

Although we won't cover the above topics in our lectures, we will refer them when necessary. Students should read through this chapter to ensure they have the prerequisite knowledge for learning computational methods in ordinary differential equations. -->
