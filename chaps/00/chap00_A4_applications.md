## Physics

### Mechanics
::::{prf:example}

The motion of an free falling object with mass $m$ is given by

$$
    m\diff{v}{t}  = m g - \gamma v
$$

where $v$ is its speed, $g$ the gravitational acceleration, $\gamma$ the air friction coefficient.

Find $v(t)$ given that $m=0.025$kg, $\gamma=0.007$kg/s, $g=9.8$ m/s<sup>2</sup> and $v(0)=0$m/s.

### Heat Transfer -- Forensic Science
::::{prf:example}

A forensic scientist is called to the scene of a murder. The temperature of the corpse is found to be $75$<sup>o</sup>F  and one hour later the temperature has dropped to $70$<sup>o</sup>F. If the temperature of the room in which the body was discovered is a constant $68$<sup>o</sup>F, how long before the first temperature reading was taken did the murder occur? Assume that the body obeys Newton's Law of Cooling,

$$
 \diff{T}{t}=\beta(T-T_R),	
$$

where $T$ is the temperature of the corpse, $\beta$ is a constant, and $T_R$ is room temperature.
